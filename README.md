# Magento-User-Import
 For when you need to create a ton of Magento 2 admin users, and you dont have a cheap intern around. 

 ## Usage
Run the `Userimport.php` script from the root directory of your Magento install. e.g. `/var/www/magento2/`

 Edit the two global variables in `UserImport.php` with the path to your CSV file and the password you would like to set for the new users.
